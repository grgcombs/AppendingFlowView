AppendingFlowView - Dynamic iOS flow charty thing 
=============
by Gregory S. Combs, based on work at [GitHub](https://github.com/grgcombs/AppendingFlowView)

Description
=============

- Intended to visually portray some (simple) process with stages. 
- A stages and stage status may be added/deleted dynamically, as needed, animating changes. 
- FlowView width is constrained, but resizes height as needed (to accommodate additional stages). 
- FlowView re-animates it's content views as it reorganizes itself for landscape/portrait orientation. 
- Handles multiple rows of stages/boxes. 
- Customizable fonts, colors, backgrounds, etc. 
- Sample application demos the FlowView as a bill in the legislative process. 
- This is incredibly simplistic, sure, but I'd like to see you come up with something better. (Fork it!) 

Technology
=============

- Written in Objective-C for iOS/iPad/iPhone/iPod.

- The visual concept originated from the [Texas Legislature Online](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/BillStages.aspx?LegSess=821&Bill=SB1).
- Clues on how to implement it came from the folks who created [NMView](http://www.github.com/nextmunich/NMView).
- You can see it in live-action once I release another update to [TexLege](http://www.texlege.com).
